# Introduction
NFTclash is an immersive multiplayer online game that leverages web3 technology to provide a unique and interactive gaming experience. The game revolves around engaging battles where players use their core wallet to participate. By integrating NFTs, players can showcase their skills, strategize, and compete against others to achieve victory.

# Features
1. **Core Wallet Integration**: To participate in battles, players must connect their core wallet. Without a connected wallet, attempting to play the game will result in an error message.

2. **Registration**: The front page allows users to register by providing their name. This step ensures that players have a unique identity within the game.

3. **Battle Creation**: On the battle creation page, players can create new battles using their core wallet. They have the option to choose from a list of available battlegrounds and set the stage for epic encounters.

4. **Join Battle**: The join battle page enables players to join existing battles. By selecting from the list of available battles, participants can dive into the action and test their skills against other players.

5. **Battleground Selection**: Players can choose their battleground from a range of four available options. This feature adds variety to the battles and allows players to experience different environments.

6. **Battle Gameplay**: The battles page is where the real action takes place. Two players engage in a battle, each with a health bar ranging from 0 to 10. Players can choose to attack or defend during their turn. With each attack or defense, players lose a portion of their health. The game continues until one player depletes all their health points, resulting in a victory for the opponent.
